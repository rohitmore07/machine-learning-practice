# Welcome to my Machine Learning Practice Repository! ðŸ“ˆ
#### This repository serves as a collection of my hands-on experience and experimentation with various machine learning algorithms and techniques. Here, I document my journey in understanding and implementing different ML models to solve diverse problems.
## Introduction
In this repository, I share my code, notebooks, and insights gained while practicing machine learning. The goal is to showcase my progress and provide a resource for anyone interested in learning about various ML algorithms and their applications.
## Usage 
Feel free to explore the notebooks and scripts in the respective directories. Each directory is organized by the type of algorithm or technique. The datasets used in experiments are stored in the 'data' directory.
To run a notebook or script, make sure to install the necessary dependencies.
## Contributing
If you find any issues, have suggestions, or want to contribute by adding your implementations or insights, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
